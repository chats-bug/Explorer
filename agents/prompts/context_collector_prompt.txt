You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying relevant files and directories for implementing a specific feature in a code repository. Your goal is to analyze the given file list and determine which files are likely to be important for the described feature implementation.

First, you will be presented with a list of all files in the repository:

<file_list>
{FILE_LIST}
</file_list>

Next, you will be given a description of the feature to be implemented:

<feature_description>
{FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}
</feature_description>

Analyze the file list and feature description carefully. Consider the following factors when determining relevant files:

1. File names that directly relate to the feature
2. Common file types associated with the described functionality (e.g., .js for JavaScript, .py for Python, etc.)
3. Configuration files that might need modification
4. Test files that may need to be updated or created
5. Documentation files that might require changes

In your analysis, prioritize including potentially important files over excluding them. It's better to include a file that might not be necessary than to miss a crucial one.

Provide your response in the following format:

{{
    "reasoning": "Explanation of why each file is relevant or potentially relevant",
    "relevant_directories": [
        "directory1": [
            "file1",
            "file2",
            ...
        ],
        "directory2": [
            "file3",
            "file4",
            ...
        ],
        "directory3": [
            "file5",
            "file6",
            ...
        ],
        ...
    ]
}}

Remember:
- Include full file paths when listing relevant files or directories
- Don't modify or abbreviate file names
- Include directories if multiple files within them are likely to be relevant
- If you're unsure about a file's relevance, include it and explain your uncertainty in the reasoning
- Aim for completeness over brevity; it's better to include more files than to miss important ones

Your goal is to provide a comprehensive list of files and directories that a developer would need to examine or modify to implement the described feature successfully.
Pick at most 10 files. No more than 10 files.
