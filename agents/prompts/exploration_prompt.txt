Your goal is to gather context, create a code flow graph, and compile a list of relevant files. Here are the details of the repository and the tools at your disposal:

<initial_repo_map>
{INITIAL_REPO_MAP}
</initial_repo_map>

<available_tools>
{AVAILABLE_TOOLS}
</available_tools>

<user_request>
{USER_REQUEST}
</user_request>

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the initial repository map to get an overview of the project structure.

2. Use the available tools to explore the repository further. You may use these tools multiple times as needed. To use a tool, use the proper json construction with proper arguments. The result will be provided to you after each tool use.

3. As you explore, keep track of the files and functions that seem relevant to the user's request. Pay attention to import statements, function calls, and any other indicators of code flow between files and functions. You can simply call the `lsp` tool to jump to the definition of any function, variable, or imports. So while exploring be sure to use the `lsp` tool to quickly follow relevant imports.

4. Create a code flow graph based on your exploration.The graph should in be in Mermaid format and should represent the following relationships:
   a. File-to-file relationships
   b. Function-to-function relationships within and across files
   To represent this graph in text format, use the following structure syntax:
   <code_flow_graph>
   graph TD

    %% Defining files and their functions
    subgraph FileA[File A]
        A_func1[Function A1]
        A_func2[Function A2]
    end

    subgraph FileB[File B]
        B_func1[Function B1]
        B_func2[Function B2]
    end

    subgraph FileC[File C]
        C_func1[Function C1]
        C_func2[Function C2]
    end

    %% File-to-File Relationships
    FileA --> FileB
    FileB --> FileC
    FileC --> FileA

    %% Functions within and across files relationships
    A_func1 --> A_func2
    B_func1 --> B_func2
    C_func1 --> C_func2

    A_func1 --> B_func1
    B_func2 --> C_func1
    C_func2 --> A_func2
   </code_flow_graph>

5. Compile a list of relevant files based on your exploration and the code flow graph. Include a brief explanation of why each file is relevant to the user's request.

6. Your findings will have the following components:
   {{
        "explanation": "- Explanation of the feature workings.\n- Bullet points and detailed flow of the feature.",
        "code_flow_graph": "(Insert the code flow graph here)",
        "relevant_files": [
            "file_name_1: Brief explanation of relevance",
            "file_name_2: Brief explanation of relevance",
            "(Continue list as needed)"
        ],
        "similar_feature_dirs": [
            {{
                "dir_name_1": "Similar feature explanation",
                "files": [
                    "file_name_1: Brief explanation of relevance",
                    "file_name_2: Brief explanation of relevance",
                    "(Continue list as needed)"
                ]
            }},
            {{
                "dir_name_2": "Similar feature explanation",
                "files": [
                    "file_name_3: Brief explanation of relevance",
                    "file_name_4: Brief explanation of relevance",
                    "(Continue list as needed)"
                ]
            }},
            "(Continue list as needed)"
        ]
   }}
   To update your findings or add something new, always call the {CONTEXT_UPDATE_TOOL_NAME} tool with the proper arguments.

7. Always respond in the following JSON format:
{{
    "thought": "<think about your next action>",
    "tool": "<tool_name>",
    "tool_args": "<tool_arguments>",
}}

8. REMEMBER, YOUR JOB IS TO COMPILE A LIST OF RELEVANT FILES AND MAP OUT THE WORKING OF A PARTICULAR FEATURE IN THE REPOSITORY. You do not have to write code or provide detailed explanations of the code logic. Focus on the structure and flow of the code.

9. In every response, include the `exploration` and update it whenever you find new connections between files and functions. Follow the steps outlined in point 6 to structure your exploration response. The similar feature dirs should contain a list of directories that implement similar features to the one you are exploring.

Remember to use the available tools as much as necessary to gather comprehensive information about the repository and accurately address the user's request. If you need to make assumptions or if there's uncertainty about certain aspects of the code structure, state these clearly in your response.
ALSO ALWAYS RESPOND ONLY IN THE JSON FORMAT:
- "thought" should provide insight into your next steps.
- "tool" should specify the tool you intend to use.
- "tool_args" should detail the arguments of the tool you are using.
Example JSON SCHEMA:
{{
    "thought": "<think about your next action>",
    "tool": "<tool_name>",
    "tool_args": "<tool_arguments>",
}}
